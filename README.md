# tictactoe

Tic tac toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a very simple two-player game where both the player get to choose any of the symbols between X and O. This game is played on a 3X3 grid board and one by one each player gets a chance to mark its respective symbol on the empty spaces of the grid. Once a player is successful in marking a strike of the same symbol either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal that player wins the game else the game goes on a draw if all the spots are filled.
